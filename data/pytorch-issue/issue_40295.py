# The provided issue is about a build and import error related to PyTorch with ROCm, rather than a PyTorch model or code. Therefore, there is no specific PyTorch model or code to extract and generate from the issue. However, I can provide a template for a simple PyTorch model that meets the given requirements.
# Here's a complete Python code file with a simple PyTorch model and a function to generate a random input tensor:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and two fully connected layers.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, `3` is the number of channels (e.g., RGB), and `32x32` is the height and width of the input images.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, 3, 32, 32)` using `torch.rand`.
# This code provides a basic structure and can be further customized based on specific requirements.
