# The provided issue is related to creating an executable file using PyInstaller for a PyTorch-based Anomaly Detection framework. The main problem was that the necessary DLL files were not being included in the executable, leading to an `OSError` when trying to run the EXE file.
# Since the issue does not provide any specific PyTorch model code, I will generate a simple PyTorch model and input generation function as an example. This example will be a basic CNN for image classification, which is a common use case for PyTorch models.
# Here is the complete Python code file:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple CNN with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and two fully connected layers.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image. For this example, we assume `B=1`, `C=3`, `H=32`, and `W=32`.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` to match the input expected by `MyModel`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for more complex models and input shapes. If you have specific requirements or a different model structure, please provide more details, and I can adjust the code accordingly.
