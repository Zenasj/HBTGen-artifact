# The provided issue is about a specific bug in PyTorch related to the import of HuggingFace transformers in the `DataClassVariable` class. The issue does not provide any PyTorch model or code that needs to be converted into a complete Python file. Instead, it discusses a performance issue and a potential fix.
# Since there is no model or code to extract and convert, I will provide a placeholder code that adheres to the given structure. This code will include a simple `MyModel` class and a `GetInput` function to generate a random input tensor.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple CNN model with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a more complex model if needed. If you have additional details or a specific model to work with, please provide them, and I will adjust the code accordingly.
