# The provided GitHub issue is about making `eval_frame` safe for sub-interpreters and threads in PyTorch. It does not contain any PyTorch model or related code. Therefore, it is not possible to extract a PyTorch model from this issue.
# However, if you need a generic example of how to create a simple PyTorch model and a function to generate input, I can provide that. Here is an example:
# This code defines a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with a single convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer. The `GetInput` function generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input images. This input tensor can be directly used with the `MyModel` instance.
