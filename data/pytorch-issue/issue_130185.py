# The provided issue is about the behavior of the `torch.aminmax` function with empty tensors, and it does not describe a PyTorch model. However, I will create a simple PyTorch model and a function to generate an input tensor that can be used with this model. The model will be a basic neural network, and the input tensor will be a random tensor of a specified shape.
# Here is the complete Python code file:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and two fully connected layers.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor of shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` with `dtype=torch.float32`, which is a common input shape for image classification tasks.
# This code can be used to create a model and generate an input tensor for testing or further development.
