# This function declares a partial order on declarations, and sorts them according
# to its linear extension. This is necessary, because there's some ambiguity in the
# choice of overload, and we want a different order.
#
# See Note[Order of overloads matters]
#
# A few examples of ambiguous python signature pairs.
#
#   All parameters have the same type, except one taking Tensor the other taking
#   Scalar. A numeric PyObject can be casted into Tensor, and a zero-dim Tensor
#   object can be accepted as Scalar type parameter (see python_arg_parser.cpp).
#   Therefore, same input arguments might be accepted by either python signature.
#   We want to always parse the one taking Tensor first.
#
#     bitwise_and(Tensor input, Tensor other, *, Tensor out=None)
#     bitwise_and(Tensor input, Scalar other, *, Tensor out=None)
#
#   If they have different number of parameters then they are not ambiguous - but
#   the difference on output param can be ignored as it's optional.
#
#     multiply(Tensor input, Tensor other, *, Tensor out=None)
#     multiply(Tensor input, Scalar other)
#
#   Both positional args and keyword-only args are considered together.
#
#     subtract(Tensor other, *, Scalar alpha=1)
#     subtract(Scalar other, Scalar alpha=1)
#
# A few ambiguous cases which it does NOT handle yet.
#
#   If there is any difference in other parameters besides the Tensor/Scalar
#   difference, then they are not considered ambiguous by this method anymore.
#   However, the difference could be too trivial to disambiguate.
#
#     foo(Tensor input, Scalar other, Scalar bar)
#     foo(Tensor input, Tensor other, double bar)
#
#   If they are taking different number of parameters then they are not considered
#   ambiguous anymore, even if the difference is only on optional kwargs.
#
#     foo(Scalar other, Scalar alpha=1)
#     foo(Tensor other, *, Scalar alpha=1, Scalar beta=1)
