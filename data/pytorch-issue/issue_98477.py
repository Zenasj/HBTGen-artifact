# The provided GitHub issue and comments do not contain any specific PyTorch model or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a complete Python file. The issue is about a feature request for the `torch.fx` library, specifically allowing `replace_pattern` to take in `Graph` inputs.
# Since there is no model or code to extract, I will create a simple example that demonstrates how to use `torch.fx` with a basic model and a function to generate input data. This example will include a simple `MyModel` class and a `GetInput` function.
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network with one convolutional layer, a ReLU activation, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` to match the input expected by `MyModel`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for further development or testing with `torch.fx`.
