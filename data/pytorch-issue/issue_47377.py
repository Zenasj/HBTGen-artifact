# The provided issue does not contain any PyTorch model or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a complete Python file. The issue is related to a build error when compiling a CUDA extension in PyTorch, specifically with the `nvcc` compiler not picking the correct `gcc` version.
# Since there is no PyTorch model or relevant code to extract, I will provide a template for a simple PyTorch model and input generation function as per the requirements. This will serve as a placeholder and can be replaced with the actual model and input generation logic if provided.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple CNN with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image.
# This template can be modified to fit the specific model and input requirements if more details are provided.
