# The issue described is related to the `torch.load` function and the `weights_only` argument. However, it does not provide a complete PyTorch model or any specific model structure. Since the goal is to generate a complete Python code file with a PyTorch model, I will create a simple example model and ensure it aligns with the given requirements.
# Here is the generated code:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be (B, 3, 32, 32), where B is the batch size, and the image size is 32x32 with 3 channels (e.g., RGB).
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape (4, 3, 32, 32) to match the expected input of `MyModel`.
# This code can be used directly with `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())` without errors.
