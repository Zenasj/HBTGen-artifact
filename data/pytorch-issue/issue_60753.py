# The provided GitHub issue is about a pull request that introduces a `@parametrize` decorator for test parametrization in PyTorch. The PR does not contain any PyTorch model or related code, but rather focuses on the testing framework and its usage.
# Since there is no PyTorch model or related code in the issue, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and the corresponding input generation function to meet the required structure. This example will be a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) for demonstration purposes.
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple CNN with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be (1, 3, 32, 32), which is typical for small image datasets like CIFAR-10.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape (1, 3, 32, 32) to match the input expected by `MyModel`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for more complex models and input shapes. If you have specific requirements or a different model structure, please provide more details.
