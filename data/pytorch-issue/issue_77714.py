# The provided GitHub issue and comments do not contain a PyTorch model or any code that needs to be extracted into a single Python file. The issue is about adding special handling for the `resize_()` method in the functionalization pass, which is a part of PyTorch's internal implementation.
# Since there is no model or relevant code to extract, I will provide a placeholder code that meets the given structure and constraints. This code will include a simple `MyModel` class and a `GetInput` function that generates a random tensor input.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network with one convolutional layer, a ReLU activation, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image. The default values are set to `B=1`, `C=3`, `H=32`, and `W=32`.
# This code is a placeholder and can be modified to fit the specific requirements of any actual model or use case.
