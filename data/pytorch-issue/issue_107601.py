# The provided GitHub issue is about a specific change in the PyTorch inductor code to handle dynamic shared memory limits for large inputs. It does not describe a PyTorch model or provide any model-related code. Therefore, there is no model to extract and generate from this issue.
# However, if you need a generic example of how to create a simple PyTorch model and a function to generate input data, I can provide that. Here is a basic example:
# This code defines a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer followed by a fully connected layer. The `GetInput` function generates a random tensor that can be used as input to the model. The input shape is assumed to be `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input images.
