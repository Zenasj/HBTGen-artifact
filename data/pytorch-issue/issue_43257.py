# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any specific PyTorch model or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a single Python file. The issue is primarily about a test failing due to out-of-memory (OOM) errors on a 12GB GPU, and the discussion revolves around potential causes and solutions.
# Since there is no specific model or code to extract, I will create a placeholder `MyModel` class and a `GetInput` function that generates a random tensor. This will serve as a template for a typical PyTorch model and input generation.
# Here is the generated code:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, a ReLU activation, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input is assumed to be a 3-channel image of size 32x32.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a PyTorch model and input generation. If you have more specific requirements or additional details, please provide them, and I can adjust the code accordingly.
