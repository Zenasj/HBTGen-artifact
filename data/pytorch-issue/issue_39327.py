# The provided issue is about an `OSError` when importing the PyTorch library, specifically related to loading CUDA DLLs on a CPU-only agent. This issue does not contain any model code or structure, so there is no direct way to extract a PyTorch model from it.
# However, I can provide a generic example of a PyTorch model and input generation function that meets the specified requirements. Since the issue does not provide any specific model or input shape, I will create a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) as an example.
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple CNN with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, `3` is the number of channels (RGB), and `32x32` is the image size.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(4, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input of `MyModel`.
# This code provides a complete and functional PyTorch model and input generation function, ready to use with `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())`.
