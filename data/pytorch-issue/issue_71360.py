# The provided issue is about a dependency installation problem when building PyTorch from source, and it does not contain any model definition or code that needs to be extracted into a Python file. However, I can help you create a simple example of a PyTorch model and its input generation function based on the typical structure you provided.
# Here is a complete Python code file with a simple `MyModel` class and a `GetInput` function:
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` which is a common input shape for image classification tasks. The `dtype` is set to `torch.float32`.
# This code is ready to use with `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())`. If you need a more specific model or input shape, please provide additional details.
