# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any specific PyTorch model or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a single Python file. The issue is about improving the error messages in PyTorch by using more informative macros like `TORCH_CHECK_GT`.
# Since there is no model or code to extract, I will provide a simple example of a PyTorch model and an input function to meet the structure and constraints you specified.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and two fully connected layers.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` which is a common input shape for image classification tasks.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a PyTorch model and input generation. If you have a specific model or code from another issue, please provide it, and I will generate the appropriate code.
