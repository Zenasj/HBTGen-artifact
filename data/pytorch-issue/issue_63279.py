# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any PyTorch model or related code. Instead, it discusses a type-checking issue with `mypy` and `pyright` when using certain PyTorch functions. Since there is no model or related code to extract, I will provide a generic example of a PyTorch model and its input generation function as per the given requirements.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max-pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image, respectively.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a PyTorch model and its input generation. If you have specific requirements or a different model structure, please provide more details.
