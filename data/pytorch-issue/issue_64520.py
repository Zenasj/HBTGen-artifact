# The provided issue is about installing PyTorch and torchvision using Poetry, and it does not contain any code for a PyTorch model. Therefore, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model to meet the requirements of the task.
# Here is the generated Python code:
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and two fully connected layers.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input images, respectively. The assumed input shape is `(4, 3, 32, 32)`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a more complex model or further customized as needed.
