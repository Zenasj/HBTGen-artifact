# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any specific PyTorch model or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a complete Python code file. The issue is about porting unary float functions to a structured format in the PyTorch codebase, and it includes a script for modifying the `native_functions.yaml` file.
# Since there is no model or function to extract, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and input generation function that meets the specified structure and constraints.
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# 2. **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image. The data type is `torch.float32`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a more complex model or for testing purposes.
