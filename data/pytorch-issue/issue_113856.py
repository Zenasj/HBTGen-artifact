# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any PyTorch model or related code. It is focused on improving the default naming of parametrized tests in the PyTorch testing framework. Since there is no model or related code to extract, I will provide a generic example that meets the specified structure and constraints.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, `H` is the height, and `W` is the width. The tensor is of type `torch.float32`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a PyTorch model and input generation. If you have specific requirements or additional details, please provide them, and I can adjust the code accordingly.
