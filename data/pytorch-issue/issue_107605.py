# The provided GitHub issue is about supporting AMD Ryzen Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) in PyTorch, and it does not contain any specific model or code that needs to be extracted. However, I can infer a simple example of a PyTorch model and the corresponding input generation function based on the context of the discussion.
# Here is a complete Python code file with a simple CNN model and an input generation function:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple CNN with two convolutional layers, ReLU activations, max pooling, and two fully connected layers.
#    - The input shape is inferred to be `(batch_size, 3, 32, 32)`.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(4, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input shape of the model.
# This code provides a basic example of a PyTorch model and how to generate a valid input for it. If you have more specific requirements or a different model structure, please provide additional details.
