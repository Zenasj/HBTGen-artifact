# The provided GitHub issue is about adding support for fake tensor constant tracking in PyTorch, and it does not contain any specific model or code that needs to be extracted. Since there is no model or code to extract, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and the corresponding `GetInput` function to meet the requirements.
# Here is a simple example of a PyTorch model and the required functions:
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input shape of `MyModel`.
# This code can be used as a starting point and can be further customized based on specific requirements.
