    Tracing behavior: trace into submodules and treat them as Unspecialized, do not
    register parameters to the top-level, treat them as function inputs.

    Guards behavior: if 'skip_fsdp_guards', many guards that would be installed
    by a vanilla UnspecializedNNModuleVariable are simply dropped, on the basis
    that a user wrapping their model in FSDP(model) is already opting into a
    requirement to not modify internal model state, which would already break FSDP without
    compilation.
