# The provided issue is about a problem with `torch.cuda.is_available()` causing the Python command prompt to close, and it does not contain any code for a PyTorch model. Therefore, I will create a simple PyTorch model and input function based on the typical structure of a basic neural network. This will serve as a placeholder to meet the requirements.
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and two fully connected layers.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(batch_size, 3, 32, 32)`.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(batch_size, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input of `MyModel`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a basic PyTorch model and input generation. If you have specific requirements or need a more complex model, please provide additional details.
