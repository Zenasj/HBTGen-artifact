# The provided issue describes a bug in the PyTorch Dynamo testing framework, specifically related to the `allow_in_graph` API and the global `allowed_functions` tracker. The issue does not provide any specific model or code that needs to be extracted into a Python file. Instead, it focuses on the behavior of the Dynamo testing framework.
# Since there is no model or specific code to extract, I will create a placeholder `MyModel` class and a corresponding `GetInput` function to meet the required structure. This will serve as a template that can be used for further development or testing.
# Here is the complete Python code file:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network with one convolutional layer, a ReLU activation, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, 3, 32, 32)` and `dtype` of `torch.float32`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for further development or testing. If you have a specific model or code snippet from the issue, please provide it, and I will update the code accordingly.
