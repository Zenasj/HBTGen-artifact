# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any specific PyTorch model or code. It is a discussion about migrating the PyTorch codebase to C++17 and the challenges associated with it, particularly related to CUDA support and package size.
# Since there is no specific model or code to extract, I will generate a simple example of a PyTorch model and its corresponding input function to meet the given requirements.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and two fully connected layers.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, `H` is the height, and `W` is the width. The default values are set to `B=4`, `C=3`, `H=32`, and `W=32`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a simple CNN in PyTorch.
