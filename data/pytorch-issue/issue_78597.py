# The provided issue does not contain any information about a PyTorch model, its structure, or usage. It is focused on fixing an import error in the `torchvision` package. Since there is no model or code to extract, I will create a simple placeholder `MyModel` and a corresponding `GetInput` function to meet the requirements.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image. The input shape is assumed to be `(1, 3, 32, 32)` for this example.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a more complex model if needed.
