# The provided GitHub issue is about a flaky test in PyTorch's distributed testing suite, specifically related to the `test_broadcast_object_list` function. The issue does not contain any code for a PyTorch model, but rather discusses a distributed test and its failure.
# Since there is no PyTorch model or related code in the issue, I will create a simple placeholder model and input generation function to meet the requirements of the task. I will also include a comment at the top with an inferred input shape.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(batch_size, channels, height, width)` that can be used as input to `MyModel`.
# This code provides a complete, self-contained example that meets the specified structure and constraints.
