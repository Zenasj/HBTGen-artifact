# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any PyTorch model code or specific model structure. It primarily discusses the application of a linter rule (RUF013) and related CI/CD issues. Since there is no model or code to extract, I will generate a simple example of a PyTorch model and input function that can be used as a template.
# Here is the complete Python code file with a simple PyTorch model and input function:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, and the input has 3 channels (e.g., RGB images).
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, 3, 32, 32)` and `dtype` of `torch.float32`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for more complex models and input generation. If you have specific requirements or additional details, please provide them, and I can adjust the code accordingly.
