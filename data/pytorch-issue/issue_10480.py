# The issue described in the GitHub post is related to a problem with using the `help` function on the `torch` module in both Python 2 and Python 3. The issue was fixed for Python 3.7, and a workaround was provided for Python 2.7.
# Since the issue does not provide any specific PyTorch model or code to extract, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and its input generation function as per the requirements. This example will be a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple CNN with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, C, H, W) = (1, 3, 32, 32)`.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor of shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` with `dtype=torch.float32`, which is a common input shape for image classification tasks.
# This code can be used as a starting point for more complex models and input shapes. If you have specific requirements or a different model structure, please provide more details.
