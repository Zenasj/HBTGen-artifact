# The issue you provided is primarily about installing PyTorch on a PPC64le architecture, and it does not contain any specific model code or structure. Since the goal is to generate a complete Python code file with a `MyModel` class and related functions, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and the required functions.
# Here is the generated code:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, `3` is the number of channels, and `32x32` is the image size.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(4, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input of `MyModel`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for more complex models and can be easily adapted to fit specific requirements.
