# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any PyTorch model or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a single Python file. The issue is related to an error when loading the `scipy` library on a Windows environment in a CircleCI job. 
# Since there is no PyTorch model or relevant code to extract, I will provide a generic example of a simple PyTorch model and its corresponding input function. This example will follow the structure and constraints you provided.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image, respectively.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a simple PyTorch model and its input generation. If you have specific requirements or need a more complex model, please provide additional details.
