# The issue you provided is about a bug in the PyTorch `Sampler` class where it does not implement `__len__` as an abstract method, causing type checking issues with `mypy`. However, the issue does not describe a PyTorch model or any specific code for a neural network. 
# Since the goal is to extract and generate a single complete Python code file that includes a PyTorch model, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and a corresponding input function. This example will be independent of the `Sampler` issue but will follow the structure and constraints you provided.
# Here is the generated code:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, and the input has 3 channels (e.g., RGB images).
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(4, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input shape of `MyModel`.
# This code can be used directly with `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())` without any errors.
