# The provided GitHub issue is about a bug fix in the PyTorch inductor, specifically related to the `can_merge` check for an expression. The issue does not contain any model definition or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a complete Python file. Instead, it focuses on the internal logic of the inductor and how it handles certain expressions.
# Since there is no model or relevant code to extract, I will provide a placeholder code that meets the specified structure and constraints. This code will include a simple `MyModel` class and a `GetInput` function that generates a random tensor input.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network with one convolutional layer, a ReLU activation, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image. The input shape is assumed to be `(1, 3, 32, 32)` for this example.
# This code can be used as a starting point for further development or testing. If you have a specific model or additional details from the issue, please provide them, and I will update the code accordingly.
