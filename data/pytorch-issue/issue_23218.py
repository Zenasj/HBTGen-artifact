# The provided GitHub issue is primarily about the compatibility and installation issues between `pytorch-nightly` and `torchvision` on different CUDA versions and operating systems. It does not contain any specific model or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a single Python file.
# However, I can provide a general template for a PyTorch model and a function to generate a random input tensor, which you can use as a starting point for your own models. This will include a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) as an example.
# Here is the complete Python code file:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple CNN with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and two fully connected layers.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be (B, 3, 32, 32) where B is the batch size, 3 is the number of channels (e.g., RGB images), and 32x32 is the image size.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape (B, 3, 32, 32) and dtype `torch.float32`.
# This template should be ready to use with `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())`. You can modify the model architecture and input shape as needed for your specific use case.
