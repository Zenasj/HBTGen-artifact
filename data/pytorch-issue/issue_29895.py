# The provided issue is about the C++ API of PyTorch and does not contain any Python code or model definitions. However, to meet the requirements of the task, I will create a simple PyTorch model and provide the necessary functions to generate an input tensor and return an instance of the model.
# Since the issue does not provide any specific model structure, I will create a basic model for demonstration purposes. The model will be a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with a few layers.
# Here is the complete Python code file:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple CNN with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be (batch_size, 3, 32, 32).
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape (4, 3, 32, 32) to match the expected input of `MyModel`.
# This code can be used to create an instance of the model and generate a valid input tensor for it.
