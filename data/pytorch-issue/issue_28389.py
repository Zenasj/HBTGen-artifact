# The provided issue is about a bug in PyTorch related to the process affinity being reset after calling `torch.randperm` in a worker process. The issue does not describe a PyTorch model or provide any code for a neural network. Instead, it focuses on the behavior of `torch.randperm` and process affinity in a multiprocessing context.
# Since the issue does not provide any information about a PyTorch model, I will create a simple example that demonstrates the use of `torch.randperm` and a basic PyTorch model. This will help illustrate how to structure the code as per the given requirements.
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, `3` is the number of channels, and `32x32` is the image size.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` to match the input expected by `MyModel`.
# This code provides a complete and self-contained example of a PyTorch model and a function to generate a valid input tensor. It does not include the specific issue related to process affinity and `torch.randperm`, as that is outside the scope of creating a PyTorch model.
