# The provided issue describes a problem with PyTorch's AOTInductor and the use of AVX512 instructions, but it does not provide a complete model or code for a neural network. Since the issue is more about the compilation and execution environment, I will infer a simple model and input generation function to meet the requirements.
# Here is the complete Python code file based on the given constraints:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is inferred to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels (3 for RGB images), and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image (32x32).
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(4, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input of `MyModel`.
# This code can be used to create a model and generate input data for testing or further development. The model is simple and can be easily extended or modified as needed.
