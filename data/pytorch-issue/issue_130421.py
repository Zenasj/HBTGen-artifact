# The provided issue is about the behavior of `torch.randint` when using tensor inputs for the `low`, `high`, and `size` arguments, which is not in line with the documentation. However, the issue does not provide a PyTorch model or any code related to a model. 
# Since the goal is to generate a complete Python code file that includes a PyTorch model, I will create a simple model and a function to generate an input tensor. The model will be a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) as an example. The input shape will be inferred from a typical CNN input, such as `(B, C, H, W)`.
# Here is the complete Python code:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple CNN with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)`, where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` and `dtype=torch.float32` to match the input expected by `MyModel`.
# This code can be used to create and test a simple CNN model with a random input tensor.
