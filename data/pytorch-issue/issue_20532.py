# The issue you've provided is a discussion about the memory overhead when initializing PyTorch with CUDA, and it does not contain any specific model or code that needs to be extracted. However, I can provide a generic example of a PyTorch model and a function to generate an input tensor that matches the typical use case.
# Here's a simple example of a PyTorch model and the corresponding `GetInput` function:
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` which is a common input shape for image classification tasks.
# This example should be sufficient for most basic use cases. If you have a more specific model or requirements, please provide the details, and I can tailor the code accordingly.
