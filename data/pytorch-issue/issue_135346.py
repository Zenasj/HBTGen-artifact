# The provided issue is about a bug in the PyTorch distributed checkpointing system, specifically related to the `FileSystemWriter` class and its parent classes. The issue is not directly related to a PyTorch model, but rather to the initialization of a class with multiple inheritance.
# Since the issue does not provide any information about a PyTorch model, I will create a minimal example that demonstrates the correct use of multiple inheritance and the `super()` call. This example will include a simple PyTorch model and a function to generate input for the model.
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, C, H, W)` where `B=1`, `C=3`, `H=32`, and `W=32`.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input of `MyModel`.
# This code can be used as a standalone Python file and should work without errors. The model can be compiled and run using `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())`.
