# The provided GitHub issue and comments do not contain any PyTorch model or related code. The issue is primarily about fixing a logging statement in the codebase. Since there is no model or related code to extract, I will create a simple placeholder `MyModel` class and a corresponding `GetInput` function to meet the requirements.
# Here is the generated Python code:
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image. The default values are set to `B=1`, `C=3`, `H=32`, and `W=32`.
# This code is a basic example and can be modified to fit more specific requirements if needed.
