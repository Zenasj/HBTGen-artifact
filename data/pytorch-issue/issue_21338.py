# The provided issue is about a compile error in the PyTorch source code, specifically related to a missing `unpack` method in the `fbgemm::PackBMatrix` class. This issue does not provide any information about a specific PyTorch model or its structure. Therefore, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and an input function that matches the typical usage pattern.
# Since no specific model or input shape is provided, I will assume a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with a typical input shape of `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image.
# Here is the complete Python code:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple CNN with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, and the input has 3 channels (e.g., RGB images).
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, 3, 32, 32)` to match the input expected by `MyModel`.
# This code provides a basic example of a PyTorch model and an input generation function. If you have a specific model or input shape in mind, please provide more details, and I can adjust the code accordingly.
