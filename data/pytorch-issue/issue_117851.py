# The provided issue is about a flaky test in PyTorch's CI, specifically related to the `torch.dynamo` module. The issue describes a problem where a global variable created by `torch.dynamo` is being garbage collected, leading to a `NameError`. The discussion revolves around potential fixes, but it does not provide any specific model or code that needs to be extracted.
# Since there is no specific model or code provided in the issue, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and a function to generate an input tensor for it. This will serve as a complete, self-contained example that meets the requirements.
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(batch_size, 3, 32, 32)`.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(4, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input shape of `MyModel`.
# This code can be used as a standalone example and should work without any errors. It does not include any test code or `__main__` blocks, and it is ready to use with `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())`.
