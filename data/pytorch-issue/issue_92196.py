# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any specific PyTorch model or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a complete Python file. Instead, it discusses a flaky test in the PyTorch CI system related to `torch._dynamo` and `torch.package`.
# Since there is no specific model or code to extract, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and its input generation function, as per the given requirements.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image. The input shape is assumed to be `(4, 3, 32, 32)` for this example.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a more complex model or adapted to fit the specific requirements of the task.
