# The provided GitHub issue and comments do not contain any specific PyTorch model or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a complete Python code file. The issue is primarily about adding and managing unbacked symbols in the PyTorch Dynamo compiler, which is an internal implementation detail.
# Since there is no specific model or code to extract, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and the corresponding `GetInput` function to meet the requirements. This example will include a basic neural network model and a function to generate a random input tensor.
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and two fully connected layers.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, C, H, W) = (1, 3, 32, 32)`.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor of shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` with `dtype=torch.float32`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a more complex model if needed. If you have a specific model or code in mind, please provide the details, and I will adjust the code accordingly.
