# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any specific model or code that can be directly extracted and converted into a complete Python code file. The issue primarily discusses a pull request for fixing a tiny bug and refactoring in the PyTorch codebase, specifically related to the `jit` and `quant` modules.
# Since there is no model or code snippet provided, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and input generation function to meet the requirements. This example will include a basic CNN model and a function to generate random input data.
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple CNN model with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max-pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image. The input shape is assumed to be `(4, 3, 32, 32)` for this example.
# This code can be used as a starting point and can be modified to fit more specific requirements if needed.
