# The provided GitHub issue is about a distributed training setup with PyTorch, specifically focusing on NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library) errors and network configurations. The issue does not contain any specific model code or structure, but rather discusses the setup and configuration of the distributed environment.
# Since the issue does not provide any model code, we will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and the corresponding input generation function. This will serve as a placeholder to demonstrate how to structure the code according to the given requirements.
# Here is the complete Python code file:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, and the input has 3 channels (e.g., RGB images).
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input of `MyModel`.
# This code provides a basic structure and can be extended or modified based on the specific requirements of your application. If you have more details about the model or the input shape, please provide them, and I can adjust the code accordingly.
