# Based on the provided issue, it seems that the primary concern is the lack of support for the `mean` operation on boolean tensors in PyTorch. The issue does not directly describe a model, but rather a feature request and a workaround. 
# To create a complete Python code file that aligns with the given requirements, we can create a simple model that demonstrates the use of the `mean` operation on a boolean tensor and includes a workaround. We will also include a function to generate a valid input for the model.
# Here's the complete Python code:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - The `MyModel` class is a simple `nn.Module` that takes a boolean tensor as input.
#    - The `forward` method calculates the mean of the boolean tensor using the workaround `x.sum(dtype=torch.float).div(x.numel())`.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - This function returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - This function generates a random boolean tensor with the shape `(batch_size, channels, height, width)`.
#    - The tensor is generated by comparing a random float tensor to 0.5, which results in a boolean tensor.
# This code is ready to use with `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())` and demonstrates the workaround for the `mean` operation on boolean tensors.
