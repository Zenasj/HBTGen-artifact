# The provided GitHub issue is about a pull request that addresses zombie processes in distributed training using PyTorch's `torch.distributed.launch`. The issue does not contain any specific model code, but rather a script to reproduce and test the behavior of the launcher.
# Since there is no PyTorch model or function provided, I will create a simple example model and input generator to meet the requirements. The model will be a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) for demonstration purposes.
# Here is the generated Python code:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple CNN with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(4, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input of the model. The batch size is set to 4, and the input images are assumed to be 32x32 with 3 channels (e.g., RGB images).
# This code can be used as a starting point for more complex models and inputs. If you have specific requirements or need to adapt this to a different use case, please let me know!
