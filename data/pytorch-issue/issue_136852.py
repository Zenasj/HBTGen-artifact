# The provided issue is about a performance problem in PyTorch's AOTAutograd, specifically a quadratic behavior in the `has_same_metadata` function. The issue does not provide any specific model or code to extract. However, I can infer a simple model and input generation function to meet the requirements of the task.
# Since there is no specific model or code provided, I will create a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) as an example. This model will be named `MyModel` and will include a function to generate a random input tensor.
# Here is the complete Python code file:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple CNN with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` which is a common input shape for image classification tasks.
# This code is ready to use with `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())`.
