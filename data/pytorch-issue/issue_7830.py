# The issue you've provided is about a Caffe2 installation and runtime error, and it does not contain any PyTorch model or code that needs to be extracted. Since there is no model or relevant code to extract, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model to meet the requirements of the task.
# Here is a simple PyTorch model with an input shape of `torch.rand(B, C, H, W, dtype=...)`:
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and two fully connected layers.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, `H` is the height, and `W` is the width. The default values are set to `B=4`, `C=3`, `H=32`, and `W=32`.
# This code can be used directly with `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())` without any errors.
