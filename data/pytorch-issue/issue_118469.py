# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any PyTorch model or related code. It is primarily about a change in the `mypy` configuration and handling type checking for the `sympy` library. Since there is no PyTorch model or related code to extract, I will provide a generic example of a PyTorch model and its input generation function as per the given requirements.
# Here is a simple example of a PyTorch model and the corresponding input generation function:
# ### Explanation:
# - **MyModel**: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
# - **my_model_function**: Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# - **GetInput**: Generates a random tensor with the shape `(B, C, H, W)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image, respectively. The input tensor is of type `torch.float32`.
# This example should meet the requirements and can be used as a starting point for more complex models.
