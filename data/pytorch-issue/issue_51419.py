# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any PyTorch model or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a single Python file. The issue is primarily about updating CMake to build a lite version of `libtorch` for Android and iOS, and it includes instructions on how to prepare and test the models.
# Since there is no specific PyTorch model or code to extract, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and its corresponding input generation function. This example will follow the structure and constraints you provided.
# Here's the complete Python code file:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, and the input has 3 channels (e.g., RGB image).
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` and `dtype=torch.float32`, which is a valid input for `MyModel`.
# This code can be used directly with `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())` without errors.
