# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any PyTorch model or code related to a specific neural network. The issue is about renaming a file and handling module imports in the PyTorch distributed package. Since there is no model or relevant code to extract, I will create a simple example of a PyTorch model and input generation function that meets the specified requirements.
# Here is the generated Python code:
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `B x 3 x 32 x 32` (batch size, channels, height, width).
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput Function**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `B x 3 x 32 x 32` and `dtype=torch.float32`.
# This code can be used as a starting point for a simple CNN model and can be further customized based on specific requirements.
