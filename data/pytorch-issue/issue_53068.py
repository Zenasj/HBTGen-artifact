# The provided GitHub issue does not contain any specific PyTorch model or code that needs to be extracted and converted into a complete Python file. The issue is primarily about adding a `bool is_available()` method to the backend contract in PyTorch, which is more of an infrastructure change rather than a model definition.
# Since there is no model or specific code to extract, I will create a simple example that demonstrates how you might structure a PyTorch model and its associated functions, following the given constraints. This example will include a basic model, a function to return an instance of the model, and a function to generate a random input tensor.
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **MyModel Class**:
#    - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, and a fully connected layer.
#    - The input shape is assumed to be `(B, 3, 32, 32)` where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image.
# 2. **my_model_function**:
#    - Returns an instance of `MyModel`.
# 3. **GetInput**:
#    - Generates a random tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 32, 32)` to match the expected input of `MyModel`.
# This example should be ready to use with `torch.compile(MyModel())(GetInput())`.
